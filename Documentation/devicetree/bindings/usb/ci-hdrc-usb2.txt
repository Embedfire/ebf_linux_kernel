* USB2 ChipIdea USB controller for ci13xxx

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "chipidea,usb2"
- reg: base address and length of the registers
- interrupts: interrupt for the USB controller

Optional properties:
- clocks: reference to the USB clock
- phys: reference to the USB PHY
- phy-names: should be "usb-phy"
- vbus-supply: reference to the VBUS regulator
- maximum-speed: limit the maximum connection speed to "full-speed".
- tpl-support: TPL (Targeted Peripheral List) feature for targeted hosts
- fsl,usbmisc: (FSL only) phandler of non-core register device, with one
  argument that indicate usb controller index
- disable-over-current: (FSL only) disable over current detect
- external-vbus-divider: (FSL only) enables off-chip resistor divider for Vbus
- itc-setting: interrupt threshold control register control, the setting
  should be aligned with ITC bits at register USBCMD.
- ahb-burst-config: it is vendor dependent, the required value should be
  aligned with AHBBRST at SBUSCFG, the range is from 0x0 to 0x7. This
  property is used to change AHB burst configuration, check the chipidea
  spec for meaning of each value. If this property is not existed, it
  will use the reset value.
- tx-burst-size-dword: it is vendor dependent, the tx burst size in dword
  (4 bytes), This register represents the maximum length of a the burst
  in 32-bit words while moving data from system memory to the USB
  bus, changing this value takes effect only the SBUSCFG.AHBBRST is 0.
- rx-burst-size-dword: it is vendor dependent, the rx burst size in dword
  (4 bytes), This register represents the maximum length of a the burst
  in 32-bit words while moving data from the USB bus to system memory,
  changing this value takes effect only the SBUSCFG.AHBBRST is 0.

Example:

	usb@f7ed0000 {
		compatible = "chipidea,usb2";
		reg = <0xf7ed0000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&chip CLKID_USB0>;
		phys = <&usb_phy0>;
		phy-names = "usb-phy";
		vbus-supply = <&reg_usb0_vbus>;
		gadget-itc-setting = <0x4>; /* 4 micro-frames */
		 /* Incremental burst of unspecified length */
		ahb-burst-config = <0x0>;
		tx-burst-size-dword = <0x10>; /* 64 bytes */
		rx-burst-size-dword = <0x10>;
	};
