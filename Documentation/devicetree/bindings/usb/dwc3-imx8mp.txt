NXP imx8M Plus DWC3 glue logic

This file documents the parameters for the dwc3-imx8mp driver.
This driver controls the glue logic used to configure the dwc3 core on
imx8mp based platforms.

Required properties:
 - compatible	: must be "fsl,imx8mp-dwc3"
 - reg		: glue logic base address and size
 - clocks	: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the
		  clocks listed in clock-names
 - clock-names	: Should contain the following:
		  "hsio" hsio root clock
		  "bus" System bus AXI clock
		  "suspend" Suspend clock, used for wakeup.
 - interrupts	: specifies interrupt from controller wrapper used
		  to wakeup from low power/susepnd state.

Sub-nodes:
The dwc3 core should be added as subnode to imx8mp DWC3 glue as shown in the
example below. The DT binding details of dwc3 can be found in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/dwc3.txt

Example:

	usb3_0: usb@32f10100 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx8mp-dwc3";
		reg = <0 0x32f10100 0 0x8>;
		clocks = <&clk IMX8MP_CLK_HSIO_AXI_DIV>,
			 <&clk IMX8MP_CLK_USB_ROOT>;
		clock-names = "bus", "sleep";
		assigned-clocks = <&clk IMX8MP_CLK_HSIO_AXI_SRC>;
		assigned-clock-parents = <&clk IMX8MP_SYS_PLL2_500M>;
		assigned-clock-rates = <500000000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 148 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;
		status = "disabled";

		usb_dwc3_0: dwc3@38100000 {
			compatible = "snps,dwc3";
			reg = <0 0x38100000 0 0x10000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 40 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			phys = <&usb3_phy0>, <&usb3_phy0>;
			phy-names = "usb2-phy", "usb3-phy";
			xhci-no-64bit-support;
			usb3-resume-missing-cas;
			snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk;
			snps,dis_u3_susphy_quirk;
			status = "disabled";
		};

	};
