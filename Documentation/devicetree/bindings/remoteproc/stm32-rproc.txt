STMicroelectronics STM32 Remoteproc
-----------------------------------
This document defines the binding for the remoteproc component that loads and
boots firmwares on the ST32MP family chipset.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Must be "st,stm32mp1-rproc"
- ranges:	Describe memory addresses translation between Linux processor
		and the remote processor.
		Each memory region, is declared with 3 parameters:
		 - param 1: device base address (remote processor address),
		 - param 2: physical base address (Linux Processor address),
		 - param 3: size in Byte of the memory region.
- resets:	Reference to a reset controller asserting the remote processor.
- reset-names:	Must be "mcu_rst"
- st,syscfg-holdboot: Reference to the system configuration controlling the
		remote processor reset hold boot
	1st cell: phandle of syscon block
	2nd cell: register offset containing the hold boot setting
	3rd cell: register bitmask for the hold boot field
- st,syscfg-tz: Reference to the system configuration controlling the trust zone
		mode
	1st cell: phandle to syscon block
	2nd cell: register offset containing the trust zone mode setting
	3rd cell: register bitmask for the trust zone mode bit

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: phandle to the interrupt controller node.
- interrupts:	Should contain the watchdog interrupt
- interrupt-names: Must be "wdg"
- wakeup-source: Flag indicating whether remoteproc can wake up the system by
		the watchdog interrupt. Only meaningful if the "interrupts"
		property is defined.
- mboxes:	List of phandle and mailbox channel specifiers:
		- a channel (a) used to communicate through virtqueues with the
		  remote proc.
		  Bi-directional channel:
		      - from local to remote = send message
		      - from remote to local = send message ack
		- a channel (b) working the opposite direction of channel (a)
		- a channel (c) used by the local proc to notify the remote proc
		  that it is about to be shut down.
		  Mono-directional channel:
		      - from local to remote, where ACK from the remote means
		        that it is ready for shutdown
- mbox-names:	This property is required if the mboxes property is used.
		- must be "vq0" for channel (a)
		- must be "vq1" for channel (b)
		- must be "shutdown" for channel (c)
- memory-region: phandle to the reserved memory node to be associated with the
		remoteproc device.
- st,syscfg-pdds: Reference to the system configuration controlling the remote
		processor deep sleep setting
	1st cell: phandle to syscon block
	2nd cell: register offset containing the deep sleep setting
	3rd cell: register bitmask for the deep sleep bit
- st,syscfg-rsc-tbl: Reference to the system configuration controlling the
		resource table address loaded by the bootloader
	1st cell: phandle to syscon block
	2nd cell: register offset containing the resource table address
	3rd cell: register bitmask for the resource table address
- auto_boot:	If defined, when remoteproc is probed, it looks for a default
		firmware and if it finds some, it loads the firmware and starts
		the remote processor.
- recovery:	If defined, remoteproc enables the crash recovery process.
- early-booted:	If defined, when remoteproc tries to boot a firmware, it
		considers that the remote processor is already running and
		attaches to this hardware state and updates accordingly (state,
		resources, ...)
- rsc-address:	Resource table address of the early-booted firmware. Meaningful
		only if 'early-booted' is defined.
- rsc-size:	Resource table size of the early-booted firmware. Meaningful
		only if 'early-booted' is defined.

Example:
	m4_rproc: m4 {
		compatible = "st,stm32mp1-rproc";
		reg = <0x38000000 0x10000>,
		      <0x10000000 0x40000>;
		reg-names = "retram", "mcusram";
		resets = <&rcc MCU_R>;
		reset-names = "mcu_rst";
		st,syscfg-holdboot = <&rcc 0x10C 0x1>;
		st,syscfg-tz = <&rcc 0x000 0x1>;
	};
