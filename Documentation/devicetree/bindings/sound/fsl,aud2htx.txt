fsl,aud2htx The AUD2HTX is a digital module that provides a bridge between
the Audio Subsystem and the HDMI RTX Subsystem.

Required properties:

- compatible:       Must contain one of "fsl,imx8mp-aud2htx".
- reg:              Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts:       <a b> where a is the interrupt number and b is a
                    field that represents an encoding of the sense and
                    level information for the interrupt.  This should be
                    encoded based on the information in section 2)
                    depending on the type of interrupt controller you
                    have.
- clocks:           A list of phandles + clock-specifiers, one for each
		    entry in clock-names
- clock-names:      Must contain "bus"

Optional properties:
- dmas:		    Generic dma devicetree binding as described in
		    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt.
- dma-names:	    One dmas have to be defined, "tx".

Example:

aud2htx: aud2htx@30cb0000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx8mp-aud2htx";
	reg = <0x30cb0000 0x10000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 130 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&audiomix_clk IMX8MP_CLK_AUDIOMIX_AUD2HTX_IPG>;
	clock-names = "bus";
	dmas = <&sdma2 26 2 0>;
	dma-names = "tx";
	power-domains = <&audiomix_pd>;
	status = "disabled";
};
